            <h3>Get The Permit</h3>
            <p>When teenagers turn 15 years old, they are eligible to enroll and begin to take driving education. At 15  1/2 years old, they are eligible to take the written test. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='mt-4'>
            <h3>Practice Driving</h3>
            <p>Once they passed their test, the DMV will issue them a provisional permit. The permit is valid until a driving instructor signs it on their first driving lesson.  After the permit is validated, the teen can practice driving with an adult 25 years of age or older who has a valid California Driving's License. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='mt-4'>
            <h3>Become Licensed</h3>
            <p>After 6 months of the permit issue date and the minor has completed a minimum of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel driving training with a licensed instructor and has fulfilled 50 hours of driving practice with a licensed parent/guardian, the teen is eligible to take the driving test to get his/her Driver's License.</p>
